The project is devoted to development of the numerical methods for combustion theory equations.
The aim of the project is creation of a framework for both research and education purposes.
Languages: Python and MATLAB.
The project contains the following sections (at least, as a plan):
> basics           (linear algebra, difference schemes)
> properties       (physical constants and thermophysical data)
> semenov          (variants of Semenov model)
> frankkamanetsky  (variants of Frank-Kamenetsky model)
> zfk              (Zeldovich-Frank-Kamenetski models of flame propagation)
> surface          (heterogneous combustion)
> flow             (ignition and combustion in simple flows)
> particles        (igntition and combustion of particles)
> meltdown         (melting of symmetric bodies)
